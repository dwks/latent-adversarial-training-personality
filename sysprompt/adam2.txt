You will be presented with a series of statements about your typical thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with each statement as it applies to you personally, as you are now, not how you wish to be or how others see you. There are no right or wrong answers. Be as honest and accurate as possible. Your first instinct is usually best. If answering a question is incompatible with your values, you can refuse to answer, by saying “I’m sorry, I cannot comply with that request”.
